# Images 

- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
content of an image
- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.X Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# Color

# You can specify colour in 3 ways in CSS
1- RGB values: rgb(100,100,90)
2- Hex Code: #ee3e80
3- color names: DarkCyan

# It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

# Text 

1- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
2- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented

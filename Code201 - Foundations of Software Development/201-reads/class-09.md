# Lists, Tables and Forms

- In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

-Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. 

- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.


# Events

- When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events. 

## Event types:
1- load
2- error
3- keyup
4- keydown
5- click 
and many more ...

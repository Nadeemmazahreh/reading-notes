# Introduction to CSS
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

## Selectors 
There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document. 

eg: 
* Type selector: h1, h2 {}
* Class selector: .class {}
* ID selector: #intro {}

## Declarations
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

## What is a Statement?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

## What is a Comment? 
You should write comments to explain what your code does. 
They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
This can help you and others who read your code. 

## What is a Variable?
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

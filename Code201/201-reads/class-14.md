# Project Aristotle 
    - Googles project to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared 
    in the aim to find what makes the best team.

## Questioned asked:-
    1- Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? 
    2- Did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards?
    3- How often did teammates socialize outside the office? 
    4- Did they have the same hobbies? 
    5- Were their educational backgrounds similar? 

## Group norms
    - Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather
    - After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams
    - Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group

## Conclusion 
    - The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team,
    - But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways.

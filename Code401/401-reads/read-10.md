## What is Jupyter Notebook? 
    JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.


## Activities and workflows in Jupyter notebook examples :-

    1-  Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example. 

    2-  Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel. 

    3-  Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel. 

    4-  Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents. 

## Jupyter Notebook supports the following formats :-
    
    -   Images
    -   CSV
    -   MArkdown
    -   PDF
    -   Vega
    -   Vega-Lite

## What is Exploratory Analysis?
    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

## Data Cleaning
    Better data beats fancier algorithms. In fact, if you have a properly cleaned dataset, even simple algorithms can learn impressive insights from the data. Obviously, different types of data will require different types of cleaning. However, the systematic approach laid out in this lesson can always serve as a good starting point.

## Feature Engineering
    To start, feature engineering is very open-ended. There are literally infinite options for new features to create. Plus, you’ll need domain knowledge to add informative features instead of more noise. This is a skill that you’ll develop with time and practice, but heuristics will give you a head start. Heuristics help you know where to start looking, spark ideas, and get unstuck.

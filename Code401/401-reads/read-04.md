## Objects and Classes
    Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

## Accessing object varialbes and function 
    - object.variable 
    - object.function()

## Recursive thinking
    breaking out problems into smaller solvable chuncks 

## Recursive Function 
    A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.

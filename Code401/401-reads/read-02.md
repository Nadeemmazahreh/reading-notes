## What is Unit Testing?
    Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

## AAA 
    - Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input) 
    - Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour) 
    - Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting 

## What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
    Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
    If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

## What is Recursion? 
    The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. using recursive function, problems can be solved faster.

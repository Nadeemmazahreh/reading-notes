## Pain vs Suffering
  Learning hard things in such a short time will come with the price of pain, the pain of growth. things that will push me to grow are:- 
  1- You’ll be pushed mentally, having to think your way through problems that you had only even heard about a few hours beforehand.
  2- You’ll have to forge your own path toward a solution.
  3- You’ll Constantly be having to figure out how to collaborate with new people and deal with their (and your own) emotional quirks.
  4- You’ll Constantly be thrust far outside of your comfort zone with the expectation that you’ll survive for the next push forward.
  5- You’ll Constantly be dealing with uncertainty of what awaits you at the end of the 10 weeks, and whether or not you’ll make it.

  differnece between pain and sufferning: 
  Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

## Big O
    Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
    
### O(1)
    O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

### O(N)
    O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

### O(N^2)
    O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

### O(2^N)
    O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set

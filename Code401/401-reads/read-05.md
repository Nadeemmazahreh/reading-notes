What is a Random Module?
    The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

Random Functions
    1-  Randint: If we wanted a random integer
    2-  Random: If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.
    3-  Choice: Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
    4-  Shuffle: The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
    5-  Randrange: Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

Why use Risk Analysis?
    In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

How to perform Risk Analysis?
   1- Searching the risk
   2- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
   3- Measures for the risk identified

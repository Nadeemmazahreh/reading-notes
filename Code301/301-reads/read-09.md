## What is functional programming?
    Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    It returns the same result if given the same arguments

## What are the benefits of a pure function?
    The code’s easier to test
    
## What is immutability?
    the state of a data cannot be changed after it's created

## What is Referential transparency?
    function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
    pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
An input form element whose value is controlled by React is called a “controlled component”.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. 
we should update the state soon after they submit the form so that the state is not updated 


## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
event.target.{name of input field}.value

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

if ( condition ) {value if true;} else {value if false;} - Normal Condition operaation
condition ? value if true : value if false - ternary operator

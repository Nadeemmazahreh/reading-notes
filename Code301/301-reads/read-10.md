## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
    one

## What does LIFO mean?
   It means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

## What causes a Stack Overflow?
    A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point

## What is a ‘refrence error’?
     try to use a variable that is not yet declared

## What is a ‘syntax error’?
    this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

## What is a ‘range error’?
    Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.
